First conclusion: The vast majority of players are male(84%). 
Second conclusion: The average total purchase per person is the least amongst men ($4.07 per person), while it is highest amongst "other/non-disclosed" ($4.56).
Third conclusion: When sorting by age group, it is apparent that 20-24 is the majority age group, with 41% of players falling between ages 20 and 24. However, they are not the highest spending per person. Those under the age of 10 are likely to spend the largest amount per person.
